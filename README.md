# Awesome-navigation
Hello Guys, this is a navbar with some animation. I made this as I was learning how to make animations using CSS and Js. I will also try to include this in some of my React web apps.
These are some screenshots of the navbar:-<img width="385" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-12 095556" src="https://github.com/AmanSingh494/Awesome-navigation/assets/130276810/a9c2f6b4-f782-45d6-a8e1-e214324af891">
